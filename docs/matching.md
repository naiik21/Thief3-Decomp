# Matching decompilation with agents

How functions of `T3Main.exe` get matched byte for byte, mostly by Claude
Sonnet workers under an Opus lead, and how the tools in `tools/agent/` keep
the results honest. The compiler, flags and split are described in
[target.md](target.md), and the research behind this setup in
[research/llm-matching.md](research/llm-matching.md): the worker loop follows
the published agent setups of other MSVC decompilations (a 12-attempt cap,
deferring as a normal outcome, a growing idiom sheet), and the rulers answer
the ways their agents were found to cheat or be fooled.

A worker takes one function at a time: it claims it, reads a context packet,
writes C++ in a scratch file, compiles and diffs it (at most 12 times), then
either has it accepted by a strict gate or defers it with a one-line blocker.
Workers write only scratch files; the tools record claims, attempts and
accepted functions for them. The lead owns everything shared (headers,
`symbols.txt`, `splits.txt`, `configure.py`, `src/`) and integrates accepted
functions into translation units.

## The tools

All of them run from a checkout's root as `python tools/agent/<tool>.py`, in
the main checkout or in a worker's git worktree. Shared state lives in the
main checkout's `build/agent/` (found through git), next to the toolchain and
the split target objects.

| Tool | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `next.py claim\|release\|status\|list\|requeue` | worker, lead | The queue, easy first, with claims |
| `context.py <addr>` | worker | The context packet for one function |
| `context.py fill-ghidra --next N` | lead | Caches Ghidra decompiles for the queue head |
| `try.py <addr> <file>` | worker | Compile, diff, verdict, `ATTEMPT k/12` |
| `sidebyside.py <addr> <file>` | worker | Every instruction of a candidate next to the target's, references by name; no attempt spent, no verdict |
| `accept.py <addr> <file>` | worker | The gate; records the function |
| `accept.py defer <addr> "<blocker>"` | worker | Records the best attempt and the blocker |
| `integrate.py` | lead | Accepted functions into `src/`, `splits.txt`, `symbols.txt` |
| `wave.py --workers N` | lead | Runs N headless workers in worktrees |
| `selftest.py` | anyone | Tests the whole chain on synthetic targets |

`build/agent/` holds `claims/` (one file per claimed function, with an expiry),
`attempts/<ADDR>/` (a ledger of every scored attempt and a copy of each
source), `accepted/` and `deferred/` (records for the lead), `cache/`
(demangled names, instruction features, Ghidra decompiles), `waves/` (each
wave's commands, prompt, settings and results) and `worktrees/`.

### Queue

`next.py` lists every function of `symbols.txt` except EH unwind funclets
(`Unwind@`, `.text$x`), import thunks, the library region from `0x10CFBFB0`
on (qhull, then the C runtime; `--all-regions` includes it), and functions already
accepted, integrated (a `// FUNCTION:` line in `src/`), deferred or claimed.
With the current `symbols.txt` that leaves about 17,800 functions. They are
ordered easy first by a difficulty score when iced-x86 and the target's
bytes are available (instructions, plus 3 per conditional branch, 2 per
call, 10 per switch, 10 for an EH frame and 1 per x87 instruction), else by
size. Refit the weights from the attempt ledgers once the pilot has outcomes.

A claim is a file that appears in one atomic step (written aside, then
hard-linked into place, which fails if it exists), so two workers never get
the same function. It expires after two hours (`--ttl`); try.py renews it on
every attempt. Taking over an expired claim, renewing and releasing run
under a short lock. `--unit` restricts a worker to one split unit.

### Context packet

`context.py` prints, leaving out what it cannot find: the symbols.txt name
and demangled signature; the target's instructions (objdiff on the split
object); every callee and global the target references, with unnamed ones
flagged and any name another accepted function proposed for them; the
cached Ghidra decompile (`build/agent/cache/ghidra/<ADDR>.c`, filled by
`fill-ghidra`, which runs `Decompile.java ... out:<dir>` once for many
functions); `include/` headers declaring the classes involved; up to three
accepted functions most like this one (opcode-sequence similarity, class and
shared references) with their source; earlier attempts and deferrals; and
the cheat-sheet entries for the function's features (EH, x87, switch).

### Scratch files

```cpp
struct Foo { int a; int b; int Get() const; };   // declarations and headers
int Helper(int);                                  // callees: declared only

// FUNCTION: 0x10A52420
int Foo::Get() const { return a + Helper(b); }
```

The file defines exactly one non-inline function, after its `// FUNCTION:`
line, and nothing follows it. Callees are declared, never defined: MSVC 7.1
inlines any small function whose body is in the file, even one defined after
its caller.

## Pairing and the rulers

The target function and everything it references carry the names
`symbols.txt` gives them (`FUN_10a52420`, `DAT_...`, or real names); a
compiled candidate uses MSVC decorated names. objdiff pairs by name, and its
relocation rulers cannot bridge that gap: under `functionRelocDiffs`
`name_address` or `data_value`, a correct function calling `FUN_10a00000`
differs from one calling `?Helper@@YAHH@Z`, and under `none` any callee
matches. Worse, every symbol MSVC puts in a COMDAT sits at offset 0 of its
own section, so the address half of `name_address` and `data_value` report a
wrong float literal as 100% when both objects define it (the self-test prints
this). And `report generate` scores a wrong callee at 100% unless
`objdiff.json` pins the ruler (see Integration).

So objdiff only aligns the instructions, and the checks are done by
`tools/agent/verify.py`:

1. A copy of the candidate's object is edited (`coff.py`): its function takes
   the target's name, MSVC's `$L` labels inside it (switch case labels and
   tables) become function+offset references as in delink's objects (objdiff
   would otherwise cut the function at the first label), and a boundary
   symbol ends each side at its code.
2. objdiff (`functionRelocDiffs=none`) aligns the rows and reports opcode and
   operand differences.
3. Each aligned row is compared byte for byte outside relocated fields; a
   relocation on one side only is a difference. `__except_list` is accepted
   against the exe's plain `fs:[0x0]`.
4. Every relocation pair is resolved to target *addresses*:
   - **Code references** (callees, globals, imports): the candidate's symbol
     must be the one `symbols.txt` names at that address, either the same
     decorated name or a `Class::Method` name it demangles to. An address
     `symbols.txt` leaves unnamed gets a *provisional* name. Provisional names
     must be consistent within the function (one address, one name) and with
     `symbols.txt` and every accepted record; they are listed in the verdict
     and recorded for the lead.
   - **Data** the candidate defines (`__real@` floats, `??_C@` strings, const
     tables, static locals, EH tables) is compared by value with the target's
     bytes, recursively through its pointers. The EH handler, the function
     info, the unwind map and each unwind funclet are checked this way, so a
     wrong destructor fails.
5. Switch tables after the code are compared the same way, and must have the
   same size.

The target's bytes come from the exe in `orig/` when present, else from the
split objects. A function matches when no row differs and nothing else does;
the score is the share of clean rows, and it never reads 100.0 otherwise.

What the gate cannot know: if the target calls an unnamed function and the
candidate calls a name nothing else knows, the pairing is a naming claim, not
a proven identity. The claim fails as soon as either side gets a name
elsewhere (in `symbols.txt` or another accepted function), including when
the function owning that name is matched. `accept.py --strict-names` refuses
provisional names altogether; review them at integration.

### accept.py

On top of a match, `accept.py` runs a lint that refuses inline assembly,
`_emit`, `__declspec(naked)`, `goto`, codegen `#pragma`s (`optimize`,
`code_seg`, `auto_inline`, ...), pointer-plus-integer casts used to reach
fields, literal addresses inside the exe, and a missing or duplicate
`// FUNCTION:` line. It then writes `build/agent/accepted/<ADDR>.cpp` and a
record: the decorated name, the class, the function's region, its `.text$x`
ranges (EH handler and funclets), every binding with its status, the flags
and the attempt count. Accepting an already accepted function needs
`--replace`.

try.py refuses a file byte-identical to an earlier attempt, counts only
attempts that compiled, and refuses the 13th attempt of a claim.

## Integration (lead)

`integrate.py` takes accepted functions (all pending by default, `--dry-run`
first) and puts each into a unit:

- `--unit`, else a declared `splits.txt` unit whose ranges hold it, else a
  unit named after its class: `Class::Method` goes to
  `src/<Category>/<Class>.cpp`, free functions to `src/<Category>/Unsorted.cpp`.
  The category is `--category`, else `engine` for Unreal-style names
  (`UObject`, `AActor`, `FName`), else `game`. Library code (from the CRT
  entry point on, outside `.text$x`) is not published (CONTRIBUTING.md), so
  it is skipped unless `--category libs`.
- The unit file gets the accepted files' declarations, deduplicated, then the
  functions in address order, each behind `// FUNCTION: 0x<ADDR> <decorated
  name>`.
- The unit is compiled with its flags and **every function in it is checked
  again** with the same rulers. A function that matched alone can stop
  matching in its unit (an inline body now visible, a declaration that
  changes codegen); it is left out and reported. If a function already in the
  unit breaks, the unit is left unchanged.
- `splits.txt` gets the unit's `.text` ranges (each function with its switch
  tables; neighbours merge when only padding lies between them) and its
  `.text$x` ranges, and is checked with `tools/splits.py` (parse, overlaps, no
  range cutting through a function).
- `symbols.txt` gets the functions' decorated names and the names their
  bindings establish: callees and globals, `__real@`/`??_C@` literals, and
  `__ehhandler$` stubs. A real name is never replaced by a different one;
  conflicts are reported.
- `config/<version>/units.json` records each unit's category (`game`,
  `engine` or `libs`, as in configure.py's `UNITS`). configure.py does not
  read it yet; the change it needs, after `UNITS` is defined and `config_dir`
  known:

  ```python
  units_json = config_dir / "units.json"
  if units_json.is_file():
      for source, opts in json.loads(units_json.read_text(encoding="utf-8")).items():
          UNITS.setdefault(source, {}).update(opts)
  ```

It runs under a lock (`build/agent/integrate.lock`). Afterwards: `python
configure.py && ninja`, compare the report with the previous one
(`objdiff-cli report changes`) and reject any regression, then run `python
tools/progress_report.py write` and commit `progress/` with the source: CI
publishes that report to decomp.dev ([decomp-dev.md](decomp-dev.md)).

The report should use the same code-reference ruler as the gate. With
objdiff 3.8.1, `report generate` on a function calling `?Other@@YAHH@Z`
where the target calls `?Helper@@YAHH@Z` gives 100% by default and 99.6% with
`"options": {"functionRelocDiffs": "name_address"}` in `objdiff.json`
(configure.py writes that file; the option is not set yet). Integration puts
the bound names into `symbols.txt`, so once the split is redone the target
objects use the same names as the compiled units and `name_address` holds
for integrated functions. A literal named `__real@...` in `symbols.txt` (an
external in the unit object) pairs with the unit's own COMDAT under that
setting.

Unwind funclets keep their `Unwind@` names: MSVC 7.1 calls them `$Lnnn`, a
number that changes whenever the file changes, so objdiff's report cannot
pair them by name and counts them as unmatched. The gate checks them through
their parent instead.

## Waves (lead)

```sh
python tools/agent/context.py fill-ghidra --next 200     # optional seeds
python tools/agent/wave.py --workers 8 --functions 5 --dry-run
python tools/agent/wave.py --workers 8 --functions 5 --budget-usd 5
```

Each worker is `claude -p` with `--model claude-sonnet-5`, `--output-format
json`, `--permission-mode dontAsk`, the guard settings and the
[t3-matcher](../.claude/agents/t3-matcher.md) instructions as an appended
system prompt, in a detached worktree of `HEAD` under
`build/agent/worktrees/`. Commit `tools/agent/` and `.claude/` first: the
worktrees are made from `HEAD`. The results go to
`build/agent/waves/<wave>.json`: each worker's exit status, `total_cost_usd`,
turns and final JSON summary (`matched`, `deferred`, `needs`, `idioms`), and
the totals, including the cost per match. Claims a worker left behind are
released.

After a wave: spot-check accepted functions and their provisional names,
integrate, provide what `needs` asks for (headers in `include/`, names in
`symbols.txt`), requeue deferred functions whose blocker is gone (`next.py
requeue`), and verify proposed idioms with the compiler before adding them
to the [cheat sheet](../.claude/skills/t3-match/CHEATSHEET.md).

## Guard rails

Workers get `tools/agent/guard-settings.json` through `--settings`. It is not
the project's `.claude/settings.json`, because the lead has to edit the files
it protects. It has two layers:

- permission rules: reads, writes under `build/scratch/`, and the four worker
  tools are allowed; writes to `config/`, `configure.py`, `objdiff.json`,
  `orig/`, split objects, `src/`, `include/`, the tools and `.claude/` are
  denied, and so are `git stash`, `reset`, `checkout`, `clean`, `push`, `commit`;
- a PreToolUse hook, `tools/agent/hooks/guard.py`, for what rules cannot
  express. Workers may write only under `build/scratch/` of their own
  checkout. Shell commands are refused when they change git history or
  discard work, pass `--no-verify`, delete recursively, run inline scripts
  (`python -c`, `bash -c`), use lead-only options (`integrate.py`,
  `wave.py`, `--cap`, `--replace`, `requeue`, `release --all`), override the
  `T3_AGENT_*` paths, or write a protected path through a redirection, `tee`,
  `sed -i`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `dd` or `ln`. Errors in the guard
  block the call.

wave.py writes the settings with the hook run by its own Python, from the
main checkout, by absolute path. It does not use `--bare`: that mode skips
hooks, including those given with `--settings`. The t3-matcher agent
definition carries the same hook in its frontmatter, so a worker the lead
spawns as a sub-agent is guarded too; that hook runs `python3`, which on
Windows must be a real interpreter (not the Store alias).

The rest is in the tools: claims, the attempt cap, refused duplicates, the
lint, a gate that recompiles instead of trusting try.py, and integration
that re-checks everything in context.

## Testing

`python tools/agent/selftest.py` (about ten seconds) needs the toolchain but
not the game. `tools/agent/fixture.py` compiles synthetic reference C++ with
the real compiler and reshapes it the way delink shapes the split:
addresses, placeholder names, `$L` labels folded, `__except_list`
relocations dropped, data moved to a `__shared_data` object. The tests run
the tools in that temporary project and check:

- exact matches are accepted: plain, float literal, switch, EH, string, and
  with `symbols.txt` names written as Ghidra would (`Foo::Get`), which pair
  with decorated names and are upgraded to them at integration;
- rejections: a different expression, a reordered switch, a wrong callee
  (named, known elsewhere, bound by another accepted function, two names for
  one address, a wrong destructor in the funclets), a wrong float, integer or
  string literal;
- the lint, refused duplicate and 13th attempts, and defer;
- claims under twelve concurrent workers, for fresh and for expired claims;
- integration: units, ranges, `.text$x`, names, a function left out when its
  unit breaks it, and a `splits.txt` that `tools/splits.py` still loads;
- the context packet and the queue order, the guard, wave.py's dry run, and
  compiling through configure.py's `build.ninja` rule.

## Checked against the real exe

The self-test cannot cover these, so they were checked on the real split:

- try.py, accept.py and integrate.py on four functions (`Window::GetParent`,
  `HasFlag`, `SetFlag`, `Options::Get`): each matched, a wrong field offset
  and a wrong operator were rejected, integration wrote the units, ranges
  (merged across padding) and names, and objdiff's report counts the four
  (58 bytes). This found one bug the self-test could not: objdiff gives
  section offsets, and a split object holds a whole auto unit per section,
  so rows now use offsets from the function's start.
- delink names the functions after `symbols.txt` and sizes them as it says;
  the functions of an auto unit share its `.text` section.
- next.py's queue over the full `symbols.txt`: about 17,800 functions,
  ordered by instruction features (iced-x86) in about 4 seconds.

- An EH function (`execLen`): its handler, function info and unwind funclet,
  which sits in another auto unit, are checked through the parent.
- Waves: a smoke wave (one worker) found that Windows looked `cl.exe` up
  from the worker's worktree; the first real wave (six Sonnet workers on the
  script natives) matched 32 functions for $21, about 66 cents a match, and
  its deferrals found the gate misreading function-pointer globals
  (`GNatives`). Workers stand in for what the headers lack (local types,
  subclasses to reach undeclared members); review accepted files before
  integrating.
- A function with a switch table (`FUN_10a85660`, a byte index table and a
  jump table) first scored 38.9 with instructions identical to the target's:
  delink labels the jump table (`jpt_...`, storage class `LABEL`) where the
  code ends, verify.py took that for the end boundary and added none, and
  objdiff, which does not end a function at a label, read the tables as rows.
  verify.py now adds the boundary unless the symbol there is not a label;
  `test_labelled_switch_table` reproduces the split's label.

## Not yet checked against the real exe

- The exe path of the data ruler on `__real@` constants (strings and EH
  tables are checked: `execBoolToString`, `execLen`).

## objdiff's report and the gate

The report under-counts what the gate matched in two cases, both to fix in
how the split objects are made rather than in the gate:

- EH frames: the split objects read `fs:[0x0]` where compiled code refers to
  `__except_list`, so every function with an EH frame scores 99.x%.
- A reference into a named array at an offset (`GNatives[2 * 256 + B]`): the
  model gives the address a `DAT_` label of its own, and delink turns an
  unnamed one into `<section> + offset`; either way objdiff's name ruler
  does not pair it with `GNatives + 0x800`.
- Switch tables: the report compares the compiled unit as it is, where the
  dispatch refers to MSVC's `$L` labels and the tables follow the code, while
  the split refers to the function plus an offset and labels its table
  `jpt_...`. `FUN_10a85660` (Game/KeyHandler.cpp), which the gate matches
  row for row with equal tables, scores 4.3 in the report.
